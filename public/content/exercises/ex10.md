What's the next phenomena we will measure with our
Arduino? Temperature. To do this we'll use a rather
complicated IC (integrated circuit) hidden in a package
identical to our P2N2222AG transistors. It has three pins,
ground, signal and +5 volts, and is easy to use. It outputs 10
millivolts per degree centigrade on the signal pin (to allow measuring temperatures below freezing there is a 500 mV offset eg. 25° C = 750 mV, 0° C = 500mV). To convert this from the digital value to degrees, we will use some of the Arduino's math abilities.  We'll output the value to the console. Let's get to it.

## Code

You can find this code in `code/CIRC-10-code-temperaturesensor.js`

	var five = require("johnny-five");
    var board = new five.Board();

    board.on("ready", function() {
      var temp = new five.Temperature({
        pin: "A0",
        controller: "TMP36"
      });

      temp.on("change", function() {
        console.log("Temp: %d", this.celsius);
      });
    });

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing Seems to Happen
This program has no outward indication it is working. To see the results you must look at the console output.

### Temperature Value is Unchanging
Try pinching the sensor with your fingers to heat it up or pressing a bag of ice against it to cool it down.

## Extending the Code
### Outputting voltage:
This is a simple matter of changing one line. Our sensor outputs 10mv per degree centigrade so to get voltage we display the value from the sensor. Change the line `console.log("temp is " + cel);` to print `value` instead of `cel`

### Outputting degrees Fahrenheit:
Again this is a simple change requiring only math. To
convert degrees C to degrees F we use the formula:  

`F = C * 1.8) + 32`

Add the line:

	var fahrenheit = (cel * 1.8) + 32;
