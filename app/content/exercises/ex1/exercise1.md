LEDs (light emitting diodes) are used in all sorts of clever things
which is why we have included them in this kit. We will start off
with something very simple, turning one on and off, repeatedly,
producing a pleasant blinking effect. 

To get started, grab the parts listed below, pin the circuit layout sheet to your breadboard using the header pins and then plug everything in. Make sure your Arduino is disconnected from the computer whenever you are connecting or disconnecting components.
